# visualizations

Project to play with d3js and data visualizations.


A few questions re: data vis and wet-boew:

1. Does it make sense to use the DataTables plugin to display that data?
https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/demos/tables/tables-fltrs-en.html

should the filters also work with the data table as well as the visualization? Or is it expected that the data table is static and the visualization is the only thing that is interactive?
How was that decision made? That doesn't seem "equivalent?"
